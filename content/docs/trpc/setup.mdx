## Installation

In order to set up tRPC in your project, you need to add the following dependencies to your project:

```bash
pnpm install @trpc/server @trpc/client @trpc/next @trpc/react-query @tanstack/react-query
```

## Setting up tRPC in your project

There are two folders of note when it comes to tRPC in your project. These are:

<div className="steps">
  <div className="step">
    **server/**: This folder contains the tRPC API routes. You will primarily work here to define your API procedures and handle requests.
  </div>
  <div className="step">
    **trpc/**:  This folder is for tRPC configuration, including the setup of routers and context. Changes here are less frequent unless you're adding new procedures or modifying the configuration.
  </div>
  <div className="step">
    **app/layout.tsx**: In order to use tRPC in your project, you will need to add the TRPCReactProvider to your project. This is done in the `app/layout.tsx` file.

    ```tsx title="app/layout.tsx"
      import { TRPCReactProvider } from "@/trpc/react";

      export default function RootLayout({
        children,
      }: {
        children: React.ReactNode;
      }) {
        return (
            <html lang="en">
              <body>
                <TRPCReactProvider>
                  {children}
                </TRPCReactProvider>
              </body>
            </html>
        );
      }
    ```
  </div>
  <div className="step">
    **app/api/trpc/[trpc]route.ts**: This file is the entry point for tRPC. It is used to create the tRPC router and handle requests.
    
    ```tsx title="app/api/trpc/[trpc]route.ts"
      import { fetchRequestHandler } from "@trpc/server/adapters/fetch";
      import { type NextRequest } from "next/server";

      import { env } from "@/env";
      import { appRouter } from "@/server/api/root";
      import { createTRPCContext } from "@/server/api/trpc";

      /**
       * This wraps the `createTRPCContext` helper and provides the required context for the tRPC API when
       * handling a HTTP request (e.g. when you make requests from Client Components).
       */
      const createContext = async (req: NextRequest) => {
        return createTRPCContext({
          headers: req.headers,
        });
      };

      const handler = (req: NextRequest) =>
        fetchRequestHandler({
          endpoint: "/api/trpc",
          req,
          router: appRouter,
          createContext: () => createContext(req),
          onError:
            env.NODE_ENV === "development"
              ? ({ path, error }) => {
                  console.error(
                    `‚ùå tRPC failed on ${path ?? "<no-path>"}: ${error.message}`
                  );
                }
              : undefined,
        });

export { handler as GET, handler as POST };

    ```

      This file uses a local **env.js** file to store your environment variables. So make sure to add that in your project. [Here](https://github.com/antoineross/hikari/blob/main/env.js) is an example of what the env file should look like.

## Creating a tRPC Router
tRPC shines by enabling you to create a router that links your frontend and backend effortlessly. When you change props or types between the two, those updates are automatically reflected in the router. This feature *accelerates* your development cycles.

This router is essential for managing all your API requests. You can find the `router.ts` file in the `trpc/` folder. This is where you'll define your API procedures.
